//! Writes, copies and removals inside a project folder that never follow a link.
//!
//! What the crate guarantees (ADR 0008, ADR 0009):
//!
//! - A file is never written in place. The bytes go into a new partial file next to the target
//!   (`<file>.<process id>.<counter>.part`, created with `create_new`, so an existing entry of
//!   that name, a link included, is skipped and left alone). The partial file is flushed to the
//!   disk and then renamed over the target, which replaces a link at the target name instead of
//!   writing to its target. A failed write removes its partial file and leaves the target as it
//!   was.
//! - The `*_inside` functions take the project folder `root`. They refuse a path whose folder
//!   leads out of `root` once links and `..` are resolved, before any folder is created and
//!   again once it exists. The error is [`OUTSIDE_PROJECT`].
//! - [`copy_inside`] reads only files of the project itself: no link, nothing outside `root`, and
//!   after the open the opened file must be the one the path names inside `root` (device and
//!   inode on Unix, volume serial number and file index on Windows). Anything else is
//!   [`NOT_COPIED`].
//! - [`create_new_file`] gives a download its own new file: an entry of that name, a link
//!   included, is removed first.
//! - [`remove_stale_parts_inside`] removes partial files of interrupted runs only in a folder
//!   inside `root` and skips links. The caller passes the age after which a partial file is stale.
//!   A refused folder comes back as an error; the crate never prints.
//! - [`is_plain_name`] tells whether a name read from a file or a server can go into a path.
//!
//! Errors are `(path, io::Error)`, where `path` is the file the caller knows (never a partial
//! file). Paths are checked and then used by name again, so someone who can write to the project
//! folder while it is written can still race a check (ADR 0009). The crate opens no network
//! connection and uses no `unsafe` code.
